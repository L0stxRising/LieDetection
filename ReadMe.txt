# ReLie Toolkit

Lightweight student toolset combining a **Lie Detection (CV)** demo and a **Port Scanner (learning mode)**.

## Features
- Real-time webcam demo with facial-landmark based predictions.  
- Per-frame confidence and CSV export for analysis.  
- Simple port scanner with configurable range and safe defaults.  
- Easy to run locally; minimal dependencies.

## Quick start
1. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ReLie-Toolkit.git`  
2. Install deps: `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
3. Run lie demo: `python lie_demo.py`

## Note / Ethics
This repo is for **educational use only**. Do **not** use the port scanner on systems you do not own or have permission to test. The lie-detection demo is a research prototype and not a reliable indicator of truth.
